# Portfolio
For homework Responsive Portofolio:
In this homework we had to create a website that include a home/about, portfolio, and contact page with links directing the user to the correct page on command.
We had to focus on using the grid system to layout our contect with rows and columns while also using bootstrap css framework for our html. This project also focused on us building the website to be responsive with all devices. By using the bootstrap code as well as the "meta viewpoint" and media queries, it allowed the website to be responsive on all devices from large to small. By using the grid system, containers, semantic elements, rows, columns, and bootstrap. I was able to start the website to my liking and was able to get a better understand on bootstrap and the grid system
