                <p>Welcome to my portfolio page! Now that you are here, let me tell you a bit about myself. I am currently enrolled at the University of Texas in Austin Coding Bootcamp. I'm an aspiring Web Developer pursing a new career path. I was born and raised in Amarillo, TX a smaller city in the West Texas. Originally I going to relocate to Austin for this bootcamp until the in-class option was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But, that did not stop me from pursing something that has become a passion of mine. The plan is to move to a bigger city after graduating from the program. I graduated from Caprock High in 2013. I went on to attend West Texas A&M in Canyon, TX for two and a half semesters.  </p>
                <p>More recently back in 2016, I was hired for a career-level position for a government agency through the Department of Energy. Due to needing a security clearance, I was unable to start until 2018 after recieving my clearance. In between that time I took some free coding courses online and really enjoyed them. Once I started my job for the DOE I put coding to the side to focus on my career. After some unfortunate circumstances out of my control, I had to unfortunately resign from the company. I used that opportunity to pursue full stack web development. Something I have always wanted to do. I developed a sense of drive and endless effort over the years and plan to utilize that in this program and my new career! </p>
